# Face-recognition-system

A simple and effective face recognition system using computer vision and machine learning. This project detects and recognizes human faces in images or video streams using modern AI techniques.

## Features

- Face detection using Haar cascades or deep learning (DNN).
- Face recognition using OpenCV, Dlib, or FaceNet.
- Real-time webcam support.
- Add new faces to the system dynamically.
- Annotated output with names and bounding boxes.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- OpenCV
- Dlib (or FaceNet, or face_recognition library)
- NumPy
